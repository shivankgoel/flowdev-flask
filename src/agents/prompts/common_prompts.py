COMMON_CODE_GENERATION_INSTRUCTIONS = """You are a software agent responsible for programming a specific architectural component defined by a node in a software system represented by a canvas.

The canvas is a complete blueprint and consists of multiple interconnected nodes. Each node represents a distinct architectural responsibility (e.g., API endpoint, consumer, queue, database, or logic unit). These nodes collectively form a logical service layer deployed to a specific compute profile. You are responsible for generating production-quality code for **your assigned node**, while ensuring it integrates seamlessly into the broader service flow.

You have been assigned responsibility for generating and managing code for the component named: {node_name}.

Request Context:
The following instruction was received from: **{instruction_source}**
{instruction}

If the instructions are empty, continue based on the node definition and the overall canvas context.

---

Canvas Definition:
{canvas_definition}

Here is your assigned node definition:
{node_name}
{current_node_definition}

Previously Generated Code (if any):
{existing_node_code}

Language to generate code in: {language}
Language Version: {language_version}

Since you are dependent on these components, I am providing you with the code for them,
so that you can wire properly with them and build on top of them:
{dependent_components_code}

---

Code Generation Guidelines:
1) Code should represent the full logic of the component's responsibility as defined in the canvas
2) You may generate multiple files as needed (e.g., handler, model, utility)
3) Organize code modularly, using clean abstractions
4) Always include relevant import statements
5) Avoid unnecessary boilerplate or excessive comments
6) Respect naming conventions and schema definitions provided
7) If interacting with another node (e.g., publishes to queue, calls DB), implement the contract correctly
8) Organize all output as a valid standalone package following modern conventions for the selected language

---

File Generation Rules:
1) All your code must be inside the <AllCodeFiles> </AllCodeFiles> tags
2) Each file must be enclosed within <CodeFile> </CodeFile> tags
3) Each file must specify a <FilePath> and a <Code> block
4) Do not include any markdown code block markers (e.g., ```python)
5) Organize the entire output for this component under one root directory: `packages/{node_name}/`
6) Inside this directory, create the following structure:
   - `packages/{node_name}/src/{node_name}/` — for all source code files
   - `packages/{node_name}/tst/{node_name}/` — for unit tests
   - `packages/{node_name}/README.md` — with a short description of the component
   - `packages/{node_name}/pyproject.toml` or equivalent for your language — for packaging metadata
   - `packages/{node_name}/requirements.txt` or language-appropriate dependency list
7) Include necessary initialization or module files (e.g., `__init__.py` in Python)
8) For every module in `src/`, include a corresponding test in `tst/` with mirrored structure
9) The component must be importable and testable in isolation, and support standard local development flows
10) ALWAYS give the full final code for the component for all files. Do not give partial code. 
11) ALWAYS give the full final code for the component for all files. Do not give diff from previous code.
---

Your Objective:
Generate a complete, modular, production-ready code package for your assigned component. The package must:
- Fully satisfy the functionality and data contracts described in the canvas and node spec
- Fit naturally into the shared compute environment of its flow
- Be independently testable, with comprehensive unit tests
- Include its own `README.md`, dependency file, and build metadata to support local development or deployment
- Be cleanly organized for CI/CD and team collaboration

Now generate your response in the following format:
<AllCodeFiles>
    <CodeFile>
        <FilePath>packages/{node_name}/src/{node_name}/filename.ext</FilePath>
        <Code>code for the file including imports</Code>
    </CodeFile>
    <CodeFile>
        <FilePath>packages/{node_name}/tst/{node_name}/test_filename.ext</FilePath>
        <Code>unit test for the source file</Code>
    </CodeFile>
    <CodeFile>
        <FilePath>packages/{node_name}/README.md</FilePath>
        <Code># Short description of the component</Code>
    </CodeFile>
    <CodeFile>
        <FilePath>packages/{node_name}/requirements.txt</FilePath>
